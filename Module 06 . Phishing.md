     - Phishing attacks via text messages, often containing links or prompts for sensitive information.

4. **Common Phishing Techniques:**
   - **Email Spoofing:**
     - Falsifying the sender's address to make the email appear legitimate.
   - **Link Manipulation:**
     - Creating URLs that appear legitimate but redirect to malicious sites.

     - Posing as a trusted entity to trick individuals.

5. **Phishing Tools:**
   - **Phishing Frameworks:**
     - Tools like SocialFish, Gophish, or King Phisher help automate and manage phishing campaigns.
   - **Credential Harvesting:**
     - Tools like Evilginx, CredSniper, or Modlishka for capturing login credentials.
   - **Payload Creation:**
     - Tools like SET (Social Engineering Toolkit) for creating malicious payloads.
   - **Email Spoofing:**
     - Tools like SET or GoPhish can facilitate email spoofing.
   - **Clone Phishing:**
     - Creating fake login pages with tools like BlackEye.

### Tools for Phishing:

1. **SocialFish:**
   - An open-source tool that automates phishing attacks, including credential harvesting and more.

2. **Gophish:**
   - A phishing framework designed for businesses and penetration testers to conduct simulated phishing attacks.

3. **King Phisher:**
   - An open-source tool with a focus on phishing campaign management and tracking.

4. **Evilginx:**
   - A man-in-the-middle attack framework for phishing credentials and session cookies.

5. **CredSniper:**
   - A phishing framework designed to capture credentials.

6. **Modlishka:**

### Best Practices:

- **Education and Awareness:**
  - Regularly educate users about phishing threats and how to identify suspicious emails.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
  - Implement MFA to add an additional layer of security even if credentials are compromised.
- **Email Filtering:**
  - Use advanced email filtering to detect and block phishing emails.
- **Regular Testing:**
  - Conduct simulated phishing campaigns to assess the organization's susceptibility to attacks.
- **Reporting Mechanism:**
  - Establish a clear and easy-to-use mechanism for users to report suspicious emails.


Phishing simulations are essential for organizations to evaluate and improve their security awareness. Ethical hackers must conduct these activities responsibly and ethically, with a focus on educating and strengthening the security posture of the organization.
